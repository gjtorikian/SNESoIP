## Introduction ##

The SNESoIP (SNES over IP) ethernet adapter for the Super Nintendo
Entertainment System (also known as the Super NES, SNES or Super
Nintendo) is basically an open-source, proof-of-concept, network-bridge
for sending and receiving any possible kind of data over the Internet,
which can be generated by another SNESoIP's controller input, a virtual
client or a custom service (which is basically a virtual client with a
special purpose: e.g. bulletin board system, custom homebrew game
server, you name it!).

So if you ever wanted to hook-up your childhood to the Internet without
spreading all of your embarrassing pictures from the 1990s on Facebook,
you definitely came to the right place.

But be aware that the project is still in an early testing/development
stage and I'm currently not planning to build and/or sell these devices
in a larger quantity (mostly because of the pretty strict legal
requirements in Germany). So, if you want one, you have to build one by
yourself (or at least you've to wait till someone decides to produce and
sell them professionally).

I also highly recommend to use this project in combination with an flash
cartridge like the [sd2snes](http://sd2snes.de/blog/) or the
[Super Everdrive](http://krikzz.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=51).

The SNESoIP is an open-source project developed completely in my spare
time. If you find it useful, please consider donating a small amount of
money. Your donation will be used to support further development of the
project.

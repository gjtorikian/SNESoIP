## Introduction ##

The SNESoIP ethernet adapter for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System
(also known as the Super NES, SNES or Super Nintendo) is an open-source,
proof-of-concept, network-bridge for sharing local controller-inputs
over the Internet.

The project it currently in its early stage, but fully functional and
could be used to play multiplayer games over the Internet.
Also some kind of server-controlled BBS system could be
conceivable as a future project.

SNESoIP is an open-source project developed completely in my spare time.
